### Installing the App on your iPhone for the first time

These instructions are written assuming you know very little about computers and to help get the app on your iPhone as quickly as possible:

1. Install the latest version of [Xcode](https://itunes.apple.com/ca/app/xcode/id497799835?mt=12).
2. Open the `Terminal` application up on your Mac.
3. Enter the following commands into your terminal window one by one and wait for them to finish:
  - `sudo gem install cocoapods` you will be prompted for your computers password
  - `git clone git@github.com:fetlife/ios.git`
  - `cd ios`
  - `pod install`
  - `open FetLife.xcworkspace`
4. Installing the app on your phone:
  - Connect your iPhone to your computer.
  - Select your iPhone from the "[Scheme toolbar menu](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/IDEs/Conceptual/AppDistributionGuide/Art/5_launchappondevice_2x.png)".
  - Click the "Run" button.
  - If an error occurs saying the Bundle Identifier is unavailable, change the Bundle Identifier to something unique in Xcode and try again please.
5. Follow the instructions in the pop up windows i.e.:
  - Click "Fix Issue".
  - Enter in the username and password for your iCloud account.
  - "Select a Development Team" i.e your own name.
  - *You will probably have to do that 7-8 times*
  - Unlock your phone so your Mac can install the app onto your phone.
6. Trust your own developer on your iDevice under "Settings -> General -> Profile -> (your apple ID)"
7. Do the [happy dance](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ckt5JgshnaA)! :-)
